Welcome to eForms, the European Union's procurement standard forms, established by [Implementing Regulation 2019/1780](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2019/1780/oj). The eForms' official page is [here](https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/digital/eforms_en).

eForms are a major update to the public procurement standard forms. The forms define how EU countries publish data on individual procurement contracts. They make it easier for companies to find contracts, increase transparency towards citizens and improve governmentsâ€™ ability to make data-driven decisions on spending. 

Over the last three years, this initiative has undergone several rounds of public feedback (beyond Github, more information is [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2019-797630_en), [here](http://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/targeted-consultation-eforms-next-generation-public-procurement-standard-forms-0_en) and [here](http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=search.dossierdetail&Dos_ID=17796&dos_year=2019&dc_id=)).
